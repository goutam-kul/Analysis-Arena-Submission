- Few attributes had missing values, one attribute type2 had almost 48% missing values.
- EDA showed that ***Legendary Pokémon*** generally have high `base_total` values, often above 600.
- `base_egg_steps` for ***Legendary Pokémon*** are way higher than of ***non-Legendary Pokémon***
- There is significant Grouping around `base_total` values of 300,500,600 and 700.
- There is a negative correlation between `capture_rate` and `base_total` for ***non-legendary Pokémon*** suggesting that as the `capture_rate` increases, the `base_total` tends to decrease for non-legendary Pokémon.
- ***legendary Pokémon*** shows a weak or no correlation between `capture_rate` and `base_total`. This suggests that the `base_total` of legendary Pokémon does not significantly change with `capture_rate`.
